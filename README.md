# Probability of correct classification

This repository contains files to illustrate properties of classifiers and testing protocols.

Main file is called DTTest.py.

Used dataset is presented in breask-cancer.data and description of variables in file breask-cancer.names.
File DT.xlsx contains postprocessing of DT.csv and LR.csv.

All other files are results of work of code DTTest.py

To improve readability of repository I moved all files for decision trees to folder DT and all files for Logistic Regression to folder LR.
